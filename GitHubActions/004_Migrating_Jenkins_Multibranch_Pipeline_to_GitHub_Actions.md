# 📘 Migrating Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline to GitHub Actions

This guide helps you migrate Jenkins multibranch pipeline jobs to GitHub Actions with a complete example and best practices.

---

## 🔄 What is a Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins?

A **Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline**:

- Automatically detects all branches in a repository.
- Builds each branch using its own `Jenkinsfile`.
- Supports triggering on **push**, **pull request**, and **tag** events.

---

## 🟢 GitHub Actions Equivalent

GitHub Actions supports multibranch-style CI/CD via:

- The `on:` keyword (`push`, `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`, etc.)
- Branch and tag filtering using `branches`, `tags`, etc.
- Conditional logic inside jobs using `if:` expressions (e.g. `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`).

## ✅ Key Concepts Mapping: Jenkins vs GitHub Actions

| Jenkins                         | GitHub Actions                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Multibranch Pipeline           | `on: push`, `on: pull_request`            |
| Branch filtering               | `branches`, `branches-ignore`             |
| `Jenkinsfile` per branch       | `.github/workflows/*.yml` per branch      |
| PR detection                   | `on: pull_request`                        |
| Conditional steps/stages      | `if:` expressions in jobs/steps           |

## 📄 Example: GitHub Actions Workflow (Multibranch + PR)

Create this file: `.github/workflows/multibranch-workflow.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
      - feature/*
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Show Current Branch
        run: echo "🔀 Branch: ${{ github.ref }}"

      - name: Build for Main Branch
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: echo "🏗️ Running main branch specific build"

      - name: Build for Develop Branch
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
        run: echo "🧪 Running develop branch build"

      - name: Build for Feature Branches
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/feature/')
        run: echo "🛠️ Running feature branch build"

  pr-checks:
    name: PR Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Lint and Test
        run: echo "🔍 Running PR validations (lint/tests)"
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- ✅ `push` events trigger builds on `main`, `develop`, and `feature/*` branches.
- ✅ `pull_request` events trigger validations when PRs target `main` or `develop`.
- ✅ `if:` expressions tailor execution logic per branch.
- ✅ Separate `build` and `pr-checks` jobs improve clarity and control.

## 📁 Recommended Workflow Directory Structure

Organize workflows for clarity and scalability:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── multibranch-workflow.yml  # Branch builds + PR checks
    ├── deploy-prod.yml           # Production deployment
    └── nightly.yml               # Scheduled nightly runs
```

---

## 🚀 Benefits

- GitHub-native CI/CD without Jenkins.
- Automatic handling of multiple branches and PRs.
- Supports GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners.
- Easily extensible with matrix builds, Docker, caching, and secrets.

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- Add caching for dependencies.
- Use matrix builds for multiple OS/language versions.
- Trigger deployments based on tags or protected branches.
