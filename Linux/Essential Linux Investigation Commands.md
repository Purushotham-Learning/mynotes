# Real Use Cases for `dmesg`

---

## 1. Detecting a newly attached USB drive

```bash
dmesg -w
```

* When you plug in a USB stick, `dmesg` shows how the kernel recognizes it.
* From this, you know the device is `/dev/sdb1` and ready to mount.

---

## 2. Troubleshooting a failing hard disk

```bash
dmesg -T | grep -i error
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 5678.234] ata1.00: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED
[ 5678.235] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 123456
```

* Tells you disk **sda** is failing ‚Üí time to back up or replace.

---

## 3. Investigating Out of Memory (OOM) kills

```bash
dmesg | grep -i oom
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 7890.123] Out of memory: Kill process 2345 (java) score 987 or sacrifice child
[ 7890.124] Killed process 2345 (java) total-vm:4096000kB, anon-rss:3072000kB
```

üëâ Explains why your app was suddenly killed.

---

## 4. Checking why a NIC (network card) isn‚Äôt working

```bash
dmesg | grep -i eth
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 12.345]  e1000e 0000:00:19.0 eth0: link is not ready
[ 15.678]  e1000e 0000:00:19.0 eth0: link up at 1000 Mbps, full-duplex
```

* Shows driver initialization and link status.

---

## 5. Debugging kernel module loads/unloads

```bash
sudo modprobe ip_tables
dmesg | tail -n 5
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 200.567] ip_tables: (C) 2000-2006 Netfilter Core Team
```

üëâ Confirms module loaded correctly.

---

## 6. Diagnosing hardware failures (RAM, CPU)

```bash
dmesg --level=err,warn
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 999.456] mce: CPU0: Machine Check Exception: 0 Bank 5: b200000000070005
[ 999.457] EDAC MC0: 1 CE memory read error at 0x0000000123456789
```

üëâ Kernel detected CPU/RAM hardware errors.

---

## 7. Verifying boot messages

```bash
dmesg | less
```

* Scroll through all the kernel startup logs: CPU cores detected, drivers loaded, file systems mounted.

---

## 8. Debugging USB peripheral issues (e.g., webcam not detected)

```bash
dmesg | grep -i video
```

**Example Output:**

```
[ 1345.678] usb 2-1: uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device HD Webcam (046d:0825)
[ 1345.679] input: HD Webcam as /devices/pci0000:00/.../video4linux/video0
```

üëâ Confirms the webcam is available at `/dev/video0`.


[ 1345.678] usb 2-1: uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device HD Webcam (046d:0825)
[ 1345.679] input: HD Webcam as /devices/pci0000:00/.../video4linux/video0


üëâ Confirms the webcam is available at /dev/video0.
