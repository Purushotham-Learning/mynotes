Daily Refresher: CA Certificates, SSL & Secure Setup in Docker & Kubernetes (Simple Guide)

1️⃣ What is a Certificate Authority (CA)? A CA (Certificate Authority) is a trusted organization (like Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert, or your company’s IT team). It issues digital certificates that prove a server or website is real and secure.

2️⃣ What is an SSL Certificate? A digital file that: ✅ Proves the identity of a server (like a passport) ✅ Enables HTTPS (encrypted connection) 
Apps and browsers use it to trust the service and secure communication.

3️⃣ What is a Self-Signed Certificate? Created and signed by you, not by a public CA. Used for internal or dev/test systems. Not trusted automatically—must be manually trusted.
