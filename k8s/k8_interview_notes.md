# Kubernetes Interview Questions
---

## 1. What is the difference between Pods and Deployments in Kubernetes?

* **Pod**: Smallest unit in Kubernetes. It runs one or more containers. Pods are temporary and don‚Äôt come back automatically if they fail.
* **Deployment**: A controller that manages Pods. It makes sure the right number of Pods are running, supports scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

---

## 2. How can application updates be rolled out in Kubernetes?

### Scenario

Imagine you have **3 Pods serving your app (v1)**. Users are hitting a **Service** that load balances across these Pods. Now you want to update to **v2** without downtime.

---
### What is a Zero-Downtime Rolling Update in Kubernetes?

A rolling update is a way Kubernetes updates your application **without stopping it completely**.
Instead of shutting down all Pods and starting new ones, Kubernetes replaces Pods **one by one** while keeping the app available to users.

**Goal:** Users never see errors or downtime during an update.

### How It Works (Step by Step)

**STEP 1. You have a Deployment**

* Example: 3 Pods of version v1 running behind a Service.
* Users send requests to the Service, which load balances across all 3 Pods.

**STEP 2. You update the Deployment (v2)**

* You change the Deployment (e.g., update container image from `app:v1` ‚Üí `app:v2`).
* Kubernetes starts a rolling update.

**STEP 3. Rolling Update Process (with `maxUnavailable=0`, `maxSurge=1`)**

* Step 1: Add 1 new Pod (v2). Old Pods still running, Service only sends traffic to healthy Pods.

  ```
  [ v1 | v1 | v1 ] + [ v2 (starting) ]
  ```
* Step 2: Wait for readiness probe. Only after v2 Pod is ‚ÄúReady‚Äù does the Service send traffic to it.

  ```
  [ v1 | v1 | v1 | v2 ]
  ```
* Step 3: Remove 1 old v1 Pod.

  ```
  [ v1 | v1 | v2 ]
  ```
* Step 4: Repeat until all v1 Pods are replaced by v2 Pods.

  ```
  [ v2 | v2 | v2 ]
  ```

**STEP 4. Why Users See No Downtime**

* Old Pods keep running until new Pods are ready.
* Readiness probes ensure new Pods only receive traffic once fully initialized.
* The Service object hides Pod IP changes ‚Äî clients always connect via the Service, not directly to Pods.

## 4. How do you expose or connect a service running in one network/namespace to another?

## 5. How can applications be autoscaled in Kubernetes?

## 6. How does networking work inside a Kubernetes cluster?

## 7. What do High Availability (HA) and Vertical/Horizontal Autoscaling (VA/HA) mean in Kubernetes?

## 8. How can ephemeral (temporary) data be preserved or captured in Kubernetes?

## 9. How do you detect and troubleshoot I/O errors in Kubernetes storage?

## 10. How can we automatically determine application load and configure autoscaling in Kubernetes?

## 11. What is a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and how does it differ from Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), Cluster Autoscaler (CA), and KEDA?

## 12. How does service discovery work in Kubernetes?

## 13. What are Pod affinity, anti-affinity, and readiness probes in Kubernetes?
üü¢ Pod Affinity

Meaning: Tells the scheduler to place Pods together with other Pods (same node/zone).

How it works:

Scheduler looks for nodes that already have Pods with matching labels.

Pods get packed together, possibly leaving other nodes unused.

Rule types:

Required ‚Üí strict, scheduler must place Pods together.

Preferred ‚Üí scheduler tries but may relax if resources are limited.

Example scenario: 3 nodes, 6 Pods ‚Üí all 6 may run on Node A (co-location).

Analogy: Friends who insist on sitting on the same bench.

üî¥ Pod Anti-Affinity

Meaning: Tells the scheduler to place Pods apart (spread across nodes/zones).

How it works:

Scheduler avoids putting Pods with the same label on the same node.

Ensures distribution for high availability.

Rule types:

Required ‚Üí strict, if not enough nodes, extra Pods stay Pending.

Preferred ‚Üí flexible, scheduler spreads Pods if possible, but may place multiple on the same node if needed.

Example scenario: 3 nodes, 5 Pods ‚Üí

Required ‚Üí 3 scheduled (1 per node), 2 remain Pending.

Preferred ‚Üí all 5 scheduled, but some nodes have 2 Pods.

Analogy: Teacher spreads students across benches so one collapse doesn‚Äôt affect everyone.

üü° Readiness Probe

Meaning: Checks if a Pod is ready to serve traffic.

How it works:

Kubelet runs probe inside container (HTTP, TCP, or command).

If passes ‚Üí Pod marked Ready, added to Service endpoints.

If fails ‚Üí Pod stays NotReady, removed from Service (but container keeps running).

Purpose: Prevents traffic from going to Pods that are starting up or unhealthy.

Analogy: A shop that hangs an "Open" sign only when it‚Äôs ready to serve customers.

## 14. What is RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes and how is it configured?

## 15. What are the common challenges while creating a Kubernetes cluster?

## 16. How can Dockerfiles be optimized for building efficient container images?
üß± How Docker creates layers

Each filesystem instruction (FROM, RUN, COPY, ADD) ‚Üí creates a new image layer.

Metadata instructions (ENV, CMD, WORKDIR, USER, EXPOSE, LABEL) ‚Üí update image config, no new layer.

Layers are read-only snapshots stacked together.

At runtime, Docker adds a thin writable container layer on top.

Caching: if a layer hasn‚Äôt changed, Docker reuses it ‚Üí faster builds.

‚ö° Dockerfile optimization tips

Order instructions smartly ‚Üí put stable steps (base OS, system packages, dependency manifests) first, app code last ‚Üí maximize cache reuse.

Multi-stage builds ‚Üí build in a heavy image (with compilers/tools), copy only the compiled output into a slim runtime image.

Use minimal base images (slim, alpine, or distroless) ‚Üí smaller, faster, safer.

Combine RUN commands ‚Üí fewer layers, clean package caches inside the same RUN.

Use .dockerignore ‚Üí exclude .git, logs, build artifacts, node_modules, etc.

Don‚Äôt run as root ‚Üí add a non-root user for security.

Pin versions/digests ‚Üí reproducible and reliable builds.

Enable BuildKit ‚Üí faster builds + better caching in CI/CD.

## 17. When running CronJobs or DaemonSets, logs are ephemeral ‚Äî how do you handle logging in Kubernetes?

## 18. What are inodes in Linux and how do they affect Kubernetes storage usage?

## 19. How do you ‚Äúcreate a network‚Äù in Kubernetes?

* Kubernetes uses a **CNI plugin** (Flannel, Calico, Cilium, etc.) to provide the cluster network.
* To connect workloads:

  * **Expose Pods internally** ‚Üí use a **Service**.
  * **Expose externally** ‚Üí use **Service (NodePort/LoadBalancer) + Ingress**.
  * **Control traffic** ‚Üí use **NetworkPolicy**.
